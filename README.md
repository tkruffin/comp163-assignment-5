# I decided to use the while loop in challenge 1 because the program should continue until the current number is not 1. 
# For loop is used in Challenge 2 because it checks to see if the number can be divised by every number within the range to tell whether it is a prime number.
# challenge 3 also uses for loops because it prints the value within the range so that the multiplcation table can show correctly.
